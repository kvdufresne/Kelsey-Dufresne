# Biography 

## Mini

My background is rooted in English education - specifically for secondary edu - and English literature with a focus in 20th century American poetry and digital humanities. I am extremely passionate about community, education, and accessibility. With that, I enjoy (and hope to continue) creating digitally-accessible pedagogical tools or thinking through new ways to learn.

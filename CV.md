## RESEARCH PROJECTS

2020-2021		Programmer and Content Contributor, FrankenProject, North Carolina State University.

FrankenProject is a Python-Arduino-Blender experience-based device that facilitates user-generated distant readings of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. When a user touches the Arduino: (1) the human body “pulls” energy from the object, (2) the object registers the amount of voltage lost to transduction, (3) the Python program performs a mediated reading of Frankenstein based on that loss, and (4) a new, glitchy reading appears on a screen. In this way, FrankenProject literally connects users to Shelley’s novel, especially to Victor’s journey from creator to spectator as his assemblage acts in/on the world. With this project, I work with Python, Natural Language Processing, and GPT2 to develop and create unique poems and textual analysis to support textual glitching and distant reading.


2020			Designer and Logistical Lead, “Follow the Bees: Sylvia Plath and Dorothea Dix Park,” Raleigh, NC. 

This event I am planning at the Dorothea Dix’s Flower Cottage will raise awareness about the mental health community in Raleigh, then and now, by illuminating the issues of the city’s treatment of the Hospital Cemetery. The event will invite the public to create flower arrangements to place across the graves of the at least 900 people that are buried at the cemetery. All the more, this event will explore Sylvia Plath’s depictions of mental illness, community, and bees to situate her works in the local community.


2019-2020		Exhibit Curator, [“When MLK and the KKK met in Raleigh” Gallery at the African American Cultural Center](https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/01/when-mlk-and-kkk-met-in-raleigh-exhibit/), North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC.

The “When MLK and the KKK met in Raleigh” featured never-before seen archival research conducted by Dr. Jason Miller, as seen on WUNC News and Spectrum News. I designed and curated the gallery exhibit as housed at the African American Cultural Center to best showcase the cultural artifacts collected by Dr. Miller, capturing the history that led up to Dr. King at Reynolds Coliseum, and focused the gallery on reframing history. This gallery will become a permanent digital installation on display at NC State University’s Hunt Library. 


2019-2020		Content Analyst and Contributor, The Don Welch Digital Archive, @donwelch.net.

With the Don Welch Digital Archive, I produced ekphrastic readings of Paul Otero’s surrealist illustrations and explored their relationship to Don Welch’s poetry. I also produced digital copies of Welch’s personal letters that he sent to his wife, Marcia, and wrote the introductory content material for the archive. Lastly, I created a walking tour of Don Welch in Kearney, NE. 


2019			Content Creator and Designer, Julian of Norwich VR Anchorhold, Omeka and Unity.

To make Julian of Norwich’s writings and realities as an anchoress more accessible, I created a virtual reality system modeled after her anchorhold utilizing Oculus and Unity applications.  Fascinatingly numerous parallels arose between VR creation, implementation, and utilization as the experience of the anchorhold, including the roles of barriers, isolation, sensory deprivation, and wear on the body. Thus, VR technology can allow us to perhaps discover and evaluate how the restriction of place and space are evident and relevant factors presented in her written works as well as help users to embody her own positionality, even if only marginally.


2018-2020		Graduate Research Assistant and Project Coordinator, [Literacy and Community Initiative](https://www.fi.ncsu.edu/projects/lci/), College of Education, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC. 

The Literacy and Community Initiative (LCI) works with community-based organizations to amplify and empower the voices of historically under-served and under-represented North Carolina youth through a publishing curriculum. Following the publication of their stories, the LCI employs a qualitative coding process to evaluate the topics and themes that the student-authors illuminated in their writing. With the LCI, I created and implemented different curriculums with the Juntos Hispanic Literacy Group, taught writing, editing, and performance lessons, worked with the students to publish their stories, and hand-coded their writings.
